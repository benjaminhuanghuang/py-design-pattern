# Description
    In the Factory Method, we execute a single function, passing a parameter 
that provides information about what we want. We are not required to know 
any details about how the object is implemented and where it is coming from.


# Comparison
    Factory Method, which is a method or function that returns a different 
object per input parameter
    Abstract Factory, which is a group of Factory Methods used to create a 
family of related products


# Real-life example
    An example of the Factory Method pattern used in reality is in plastic toy
construction. The molding powder used to construct plastic toys is the same,
but different figures can be produced using different plastic molds. 
This is like having a Factory Method in which the input is the name of the figure that we
want (duck and car) and the output is the plastic figure that we requested.


# Software example
    The Django framework uses the Factory Method pattern for creating the fields
of a form. The forms module of Django supports the creation of different kinds
of fields (CharField, EmailField) and customizations (max_length, required)
